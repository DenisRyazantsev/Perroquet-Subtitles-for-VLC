# Perroquet Subtitles for VLC

Train your listening comprehension by rewriting your favorite movies' subs (with correction)

## Description

This Lua extension for VLC enables you to practice your listening comprehension in a foreign language. 

Assuming you have a movie/video file with a synced subtitle file (.srt) in original language (or at least in the same language as the sound track):

* Perroquet Subtitles for VLC "cuts" the movie in sequences
* In each sequence, you try to understand what is said in the movie and write your guess in the input field
* Perroquet compares what you guess with the actual subbtitles of the movie and helps you making progress
